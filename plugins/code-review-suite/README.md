# Code Review Plugin

Deep code review using specialist agents, cross-review agents, and a frontier-model
synthesiser. Includes a PR review skill and commands for pre-review analysis and
addressing PR comments.

### Phase 0: intent ledger and CI status

Before any specialists run, the pipeline captures the change's intent and CI status.

**Intent ledger:** the pipeline reads (in priority order) any in-diff prose document
(`docs/`, `design/`, `specs/`, `rfcs/`, `proposals/`, `adr/`, or repo-configured paths via
`.claude/code-review.toml`), a verbatim prompt block (`Prompt:` section in the PR body or
commit message), the PR body itself, and (for local pre-review only) the branch commit
subjects. The first source containing a narrative paragraph (≥ 2 sentences, > 7 words,
not a verbatim PR template) becomes the ledger. Without a sufficient source, the pipeline
halts with `REQUEST_CHANGES` (PR mode) or an inline prompt (local mode) — no specialists
fan out, no synthesiser is dispatched.

**CI status (PR mode only):** after the body check, the pipeline fetches `gh pr checks`.
Definitive failures (`FAILURE`, `ERROR`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`) and transient failures
(`TIMED_OUT`) prompt for explicit reviewer acknowledgement before fan-out. `CANCELLED` is
not treated as a failure (multi-trigger workflows legitimately cancel one trigger when
another takes over). The synthesiser constrains the verdict to `REQUEST_CHANGES` or
`COMMENT` whenever definitive failures are present — it never recommends `APPROVE`.

### Specialists

The full review path dispatches 9 core specialists (up to 18 with all conditionals):
`security-reviewer`, `correctness-reviewer`, `api-contract-reviewer`, `consistency-reviewer`, `style-reviewer`,
`archaeology-reviewer`, `reuse-reviewer`, `efficiency-reviewer`, `alignment-reviewer`, plus
conditional specialists by file type: `jbinspect-reviewer` (C#), `ui-reviewer` (visual
components), `eslint-reviewer` (JS/TS), `ruff-reviewer` (Python incl. notebooks),
`trivy-reviewer` (IaC: Terraform, Dockerfile, Kubernetes, Helm, CFN),
`housekeeper-reviewer` (dependency/version freshness + maintenance-health: GitHub Actions,
workflow runners, npm, NuGet, Docker base images, PyPI), `test-quality-reviewer`
(false-green test detection — test files only), `test-adequacy-reviewer` (new production code lacking a direct test, or a new wire contract whose producer side is untested), and `latent-hazard-reviewer` (silent-conditional hazards — a mechanism present in the diff that fails silently only under a concrete named trigger).

The five static-analysis specialists (`jbinspect`, `eslint`, `ruff`, `trivy`,
`housekeeper`) share the cross-cutting contract in `includes/static-analysis-context.md`
and are excluded from cross-review (their tool output does not benefit from cross-domain
evaluation).

### Version-freshness rule

The `housekeeper-reviewer` verifies against the live registry that dependencies (npm,
NuGet, PyPI), GitHub Actions, runners, and Docker base images are at their latest GA
release, and flags packages the registry marks deprecated, unlisted, or yanked
(maintenance-health). Its deterministic engine
(`bin/housekeeper-freshness`) parses in-scope sources, fetches latest-GA from the
registries, and emits stale-version findings — uniform `Suggestion` severity ("staleness is
a smell, not a defect"). When a stale version also has a known advisory, the
`security-reviewer`'s version-safety check (#6a) escalates it to Important or Critical via
cross-review.

## Architecture

The review pipeline (`includes/review-pipeline.md`) does inline prep and classification,
then hands every review to the deterministic Workflow core (`workflows/review-core.mjs`) —
the **sole orchestration engine**. There is no inline specialist-dispatch fallback: the
pipeline's Step 3.5 calls the Workflow unconditionally, and the orchestrator only posts the
sealed bundle the Workflow returns. A plugin-shipped `PreToolUse(Agent)` hook
(`hooks/reviewer-dispatch-observe.sh`) logs any main-session reviewer dispatch in observe
mode, making the single-path guarantee measurable.

1. **Inline prep** — Phase 0 intent ledger, Phase 0.6 CI status gate, base branch determination, diff measurement, C#/UI/deletion/security detection
2. **Trivial-mode (Phase 0.7)** — orchestrator-only mini-review for docs/config-only diffs (≤3 files, ≤30 lines, allow-listed extensions, excluding load-bearing prompt paths under `plugins/*/agents|skills|commands|includes/`). Hard cap of 3 inline comments and a user-confirm gate before posting. Override with the `--force` argument or `intent.skip_trivial_check = true` in `.claude/code-review.toml`. Falls through to the lightweight or full path when the bar is not met.
3. **Classification** — Step 3 computes the route (`lightweight` for small diffs: ≤5 files, ≤150 lines, no significant deletions, no security-sensitive areas; `full` otherwise) and Step 3.5 passes it to the Workflow.
4. **Workflow core** — the lightweight route runs a single `code-analysis` pass inside the Workflow; the full route dispatches 9 core specialists plus up to 9 conditional specialists (C#, UI, JS/TS, Python, IaC, dependency freshness, test quality, test adequacy, latent hazard) in parallel, then fresh cross-review agents evaluate peer findings (excluding the five static-analysis specialists — see `includes/static-analysis-context.md`), then a synthesiser produces a tiered report. All of this is implemented in `review-core.mjs`.

## Agents

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| `code-analysis` | Lightweight single-agent review (small diffs) |
| `security-reviewer` | Injection, auth bypass, secrets, OWASP top 10, version safety/pinning, SSRF, path traversal |
| `correctness-reviewer` | Logic errors, off-by-one, null derefs, race conditions, async/await pitfalls |
| `api-contract-reviewer` | Hallucinated/nonexistent APIs, wrong signatures/versions, deprecated API usage, and comment-truth (comments that misdescribe the code) — always-on core |
| `consistency-reviewer` | Violations of project conventions (CLAUDE.md, .editorconfig, linting configs) |
| `style-reviewer` | Readability, unnecessary complexity, dead code, naming clarity |
| `archaeology-reviewer` | Investigates deleted/modified code for hidden historical intent |
| `reuse-reviewer` | Missed reuse of existing utilities, helpers, and patterns |
| `efficiency-reviewer` | Performance issues, N+1 patterns, missed concurrency, resource leaks |
| `alignment-reviewer` | Intent drift and scope creep against the captured intent ledger |
| `jbinspect-reviewer` | JetBrains InspectCode static analysis for C# (conditional — `.cs` files only) |
| `eslint-reviewer` | ESLint or Biome static analysis for JS/TS (conditional — `.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts`/`.vue`/`.svelte` files only) |
| `ruff-reviewer` | Ruff static analysis for Python (conditional — `.py`/`.ipynb` files only; notebooks via Ruff ≥ 0.6.0 or `nbqa` fallback) |
| `trivy-reviewer` | `trivy config` IaC security analysis (conditional — Terraform / Dockerfile / Kubernetes / Helm / CFN files only) |
| `housekeeper-reviewer` | Dependency/version freshness + maintenance-health — flags GitHub Actions, workflow runners, npm, NuGet, Docker base images, and PyPI packages behind latest GA or marked deprecated/unlisted/yanked (conditional — workflows + `package.json` + `*.csproj`/`*.props` + `pyproject.toml`/`requirements*.txt` + Dockerfiles; registry-backed deterministic engine) |
| `test-quality-reviewer` | False-green test detection — no-assert, tautological, asserts-on-the-mock, over-mocking (conditional — test files only) |
| `test-adequacy-reviewer` | Absent coverage on new production code — untested new/changed public types (F1) and untested producers of new wire contracts/DTOs (F4) (conditional — fires on changed non-test C#/Python/TS-JS source) |
| `latent-hazard-reviewer` | Silent-conditional hazards — a mechanism present in the diff that fails silently only under a concrete named trigger (e.g. an optional column read that blanks to a legitimate-looking value on source drift) (conditional — fires on changed non-test C#/Python/TS-JS source) |
| `ui-reviewer` | UI/UX quality, accessibility, usability (conditional — visual component files only) |
| `cross-reviewer` | Domain-focused cross-review — evaluates peer findings through a single domain lens |
| `review-synthesiser` | Frontier-model synthesis — independent deep analysis, tiered report with cross-review integration |

## Skill

- **review-gh-pr** — Review a GitHub PR with inline comments. Automatically routes to lightweight
  or full pipeline review based on diff size. Usage: `/review-gh-pr <pr-number-or-url>`

## Commands

- **pre-review** — Analyse local changes before creating a PR. Usage: `/pre-review [base-branch | EMPTY_TREE] [Path scope: <pathspec>]`
- **address-pr-comments** — Fetch unresolved PR comments and address them systematically.
  Usage: `/address-pr-comments <pr-number-or-url>`

## Known Limitations

- **Prompt injection surface:** The PR review skill and address-pr-comments command ingest PR
  titles, bodies, and review comment content from GitHub. Since this content is user-supplied, a
  malicious collaborator could craft adversarial instructions in PR descriptions or comments.
  Agent system prompts and user confirmation steps mitigate this, but treat all GitHub-sourced
  content with appropriate scepticism in multi-contributor repositories.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` (GitHub CLI) — required for PR interactions; graceful fallback for base branch if absent
- `jb` (JetBrains CLI) — optional, only needed for C# InspectCode analysis
- `eslint` or `biome` — optional, only needed for JS/TS projects. The reviewer prefers project-local binaries (`<project>/node_modules/.bin/`) over global; install via the project's own `npm install` rather than globally.
- `ruff` (`brew install ruff`) — optional, only needed for Python projects. For Jupyter notebook support on Ruff < 0.6.0, also install `nbqa` (`pip install nbqa`).
- `trivy` (`brew install trivy`) — optional, only needed for IaC security analysis. First run on a clean machine fetches the policy DB (~10s slower); subsequent runs are fast.
- `python3` (≥3.11 for PyPI `pyproject.toml` parsing via `tomllib`) — required for the `housekeeper-reviewer` dependency-freshness engine (`bin/housekeeper-freshness`). Stdlib only; no pip packages. Live runs need outbound HTTPS to npm, PyPI, container registries, and the GitHub API.
- **Background subagent dispatch:** When the housekeeper runs as a dispatched background subagent (the normal mode in `review-gh-pr`), the host machine must pre-authorise the `housekeeper-freshness` command in `hooks/allow-permissions.sh` and `permissions.allow` (pattern: `Bash(housekeeper-freshness:*)`). Without this, the subagent auto-denies the engine call. The same pattern applies to `ruff`, `trivy`, `eslint`, and `jb` — all static-analysis engine binaries require host-side permission for background dispatch.
- `playwright-cli` skill — optional, enables visual verification of UI reviewer findings
